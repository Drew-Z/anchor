# Current Development State

Updated: 2026-09-05. This is the current execution pointer, not a release approval.

## Development Mode

- Codex owns the complete development loop, including UI implementation and emulator verification, under `../AGENTS.md`.
- Canonical checkout: `D:\workspace4Cursor\learn\anchor`, branch `codex/anchor-web-demo`.
- Transition baseline: `173a6c9a039fba27f8ad439a870f6306f66bc0f2`.
- Workflow migration commit: `54ab396` (`docs: switch Anchor development to Codex only`). Current code is the canonical branch HEAD; the transition baseline is not a reset target.
- The old `anchor-web-productization-loop` automation is absent in the app, confirmed by the automation API on 2026-09-05. No replacement schedule was created; work continues in the current task. Other projects' automations are unrelated.
- Claude task `20260905-135936-e5d2eef4` failed before editing. Its initial agent and both recovery sessions have been stopped. Its provider failures and exhausted retries are historical evidence, not a current development blocker or a task to resume.

## Repository Boundaries

- `D:\Agent\codex\worktrees\anchor-claude-web-productization` is clean at the transition baseline and retained for reference only.
- `D:\Agent\codex\worktrees\anchor-claude-agent-recovery` is clean at `0133321c74d63c53db6afc681fd8422e50659566`. That commit is not an ancestor of the current branch; do not automatically merge or delete it.
- Keep both external task journals and worktrees. No cleanup of pre-existing files is authorized by their age or naming alone.
- Preserve the untracked user reports `docs/TECHNICAL_MODEL_ACCEPTANCE_2026-08-26.md` and `docs/TECHNICAL_MODEL_ACCEPTANCE_2026-08-26_2004.md`; do not stage them.
- Machine-wide Claude installation and settings are not part of this project migration.

## Completed Before The Transition

- `173a6c9`: Agent home header hierarchy.
- `6b08bc3`: Learning home visual hierarchy.
- `f0a637b`: Web gallery integration using actual Android screenshots.
- `eaa748e` and `38177c5`: narrow top bar and large-text layout fixes.

## Latest Completed Leaf

Agent home learning plan visual hierarchy, implemented directly by Codex.

- Input: the existing workspace snapshot, plan, callbacks, strings, and shared AppColors.
- Output: a quiet white plan surface, readable ink hierarchy, restrained green route accent and primary action, and wrapping at 320 logical pixels / 200% text.
- Implementation scope: `_LearningAgentPlanCard`, `_PlanDetailsDisclosure`, `_PlanMetric`, `_PlanScopeChip`, `_PlanScoreChip`, and `_PlanLoadingCard` in `lib/features/agent/agent_home_screen.dart`; focused layout coverage in the existing Agent widget tests when needed.
- Preserve providers, routes, events, enabled/disabled rules, sessions, storage, and all user-facing strings.
- Acceptance: Agent home navigation and unified workspace tests, Flutter analysis, formatting, full Flutter tests, real emulator screenshots, and `git diff --check`.
- Status: implemented and verified by Codex on 2026-09-05.
- Result: white surface with a 1px neutral border; route title and scope wrap fully; statistics use unframed labels with stronger values; secondary copy has lower weight; the green CTA retains its callbacks and readable disabled colors.
- New regression coverage checks 390px / 100% and 320px / 200% labels and disclosure. The 200% title check failed on the original implementation and passed after the change.

## Current Verification

- `flutter test --no-pub test/agent_home_navigation_widget_test.dart test/learning_agent_unified_workspace_test.dart`: 14 passed.
- `flutter test --no-pub`: 397 passed, zero failures, in the canonical checkout.
- `flutter analyze --no-pub --no-fatal-infos`: no issues found.
- Dart formatting and `git diff --check`: passed.
- Current debug build ran on the real Android 16 / API 36 emulator. Screenshots were inspected at 1080x2400 / 100% text and 840x2400 / 200% text (density 420, 320 logical pixels). Route/scope labels wrap, the primary action remains visible, and disclosure expands. App-PID logs contain zero layout-overflow matches.
- Restored emulator size to 1080x2400 and font scale to 1.0; Flutter run exited normally. Screenshot artifacts are outside Git under the local Codex visualization directory, named `anchor-plan-codex-20260905-{normal,large,details}.png`.

The previous worktree's 393-pass / 2-failure report is historical. Its frozen-hash and secure-storage transform failures did not reproduce in this canonical-checkout run. No frozen evidence or unrelated build files were changed to resolve them.

The existing debug startup `Zone mismatch` warning still occurs at `lib/main.dart`; it is separate from the plan-card changes and remains an open reliability candidate.

## Next Bounded Candidate

Review large-text readability inside the expanded plan evidence, specifically `_AgentSessionSummaryView`, `_AgentSessionRuleRow`, and `_FocusPointRow`. The emulator shows existing ellipsis on the summary title, evidence constraint, and focus title at 320px / 200%. Confirm which labels need full wrapping while preserving all routes, strings, state, and actions. This work has not started; do not restart the completed plan-card leaf.

## Release Boundary

Android identity remains `cc.eu.playlab.anchor`, database `anchor_learning.db`, candidate `1.0.0+2005`. Web remains a separate static demo with local data and no AI provider calls.

Private Alpha remains `HOLD`: `cohort_pending`, `release_day_acceptance_primary_stale`, and `physical_device_evidence_stale`. See `PRODUCTIZATION_RELEASE_PLAN.md` for dated artifact evidence. Emulator/UI checks do not establish real-device acceptance or a cohort decision. Push, deployment, release signing, and distribution remain outside the current task.
